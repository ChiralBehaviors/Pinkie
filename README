Pinkie - a minimal NIO socket channel handler

Pinkie is licenced under Version 2.1 of the LGPL

This small library provides a minimal, but full featured NIO 
socket channel handler.  Pinkie provides a generic selectable 
ChannelHandler for both inbound and outbound sockets.  The 
library provides an abstract superclass for the concrete handling
of the actual SocketChannels, as well as an abstract superclass
for the ServerSocketChannel handler.  Rather than using a factory
class, this package requires the implementor to connect the
SocketChannelHandler subclass with the ServerSocketChannelHandlerClass
via the imlementation of the abstract method 
	ChannelHandler.createHandler(SocketChannel)
I'm sure there's a better way to do this that is sanctioned by the
gods that enforce such things, but this works.
