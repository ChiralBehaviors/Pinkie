Pinkie - a minimal NIO socket channel handler

Pinkie is licenced under Version 2.1 of the LGPL

This small library provides a minimal, but full featured NIO socket channel handler.  Pinkie provides a generic selectable ChannelHandler for both inbound and outbound sockets.  The library provides the concrete handling of SocketChannels, as well as a ServerSocketChannel handler.  Pinkie uses a factory to create instances of the event handlers for SocketChannel events.

Pinkie requires Maven 2.x to build.  To build Pinkie, cd into the root directory and do:

    $ mvn clean install
    
For examples on how to use Pinkie, see the unit tests.
